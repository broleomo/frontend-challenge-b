# Frontend Challenge

## Job listings with filtering

![Design preview for the Job listings with filtering coding challenge](./design/desktop-design.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this job listing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You should complete this challenge using React with JavaScript or Typescript.  O, you can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.


## Setup
An initial application has been set up for you using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/).  You will use this as a base to complete the challenge.

To set up the application move to the project directory and run `npm i`

To run the application run `npm start`

To run unit tests run `npm test`

You should see the application running on http://localhost:3000/ 

For now, all the app does is print `Hello` to the screen.


Your users should be able to:

- View the layout for the site in desktop and/or mobile resolutions
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories

### Filtering

Use the [data.json](./src/data.json) file to pull the data and then dynamically add the content.

To add a filter, the user needs to click on the tablets on the right-side of the listing on desktop or the bottom on mobile. For each filter added, only listings containing all selected filters should be returned.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. Implementing either design is fine.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

You will find all the required assets in the `src/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Project requirements

1. Create a fork of this repo on GitHub.
1. Create your application, implementing the features described above.
   - View the layout for the site in desktop and/or mobile resolutions
   - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
   - Filter job listings based on the categories
1. Bonus points for:
   - Unit Tests
   - Responsive design
   - Hosting the app for preview
   - Thorough README doc
   - Well commented code
   - Good organization

## (Optional) Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

You can host your site using one of these solutions or any other provider you trust. [Read more about recommended and trusted hosts](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe).

## Create a custom `README.md`

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.

The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.

Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.

## Submitting your solution

Provide your technical recruiter contact with a link to your fork or add any recommended reviewers to your fork.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
